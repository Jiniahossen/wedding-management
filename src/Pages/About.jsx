                <p className=" text-lg font-serif font-normal"><span className=" text-8xl font-serif font-medium">H</span>i there! Welcome to Brides, where every couple, every wedding, and every love is celebrated. Whether you are a soon-to-be-wed, newlywed, wedding party member, or guest, we are so excited to be on this journey with you.</p><br />
                <p className=" text-lg font-serif font-normal">A bit about us: We’ve been around for 89 years and counting, making us the most seasoned wedding publication in the United States. However, we didn’t always carry the name Brides. When we printed our first pages in 1934, the title was So You’re Going to Be Married. About 25 years later, that turned into The Bride’s Magazine, which was then shortened to Bride’s. Eventually, we dropped the apostrophe and said “I do” to the name we all know and love today: Brides. </p><br />
                <p className=" text-lg font-serif font-normal">We’re also redefining the term “bride” and the meaning behind our name. To us, the traditional term is not limited to a woman who is getting married. Rather, it speaks to people of all genders who are in love and ready to share a vow of forever with their special someone. No matter who you are or what kind of nuptials you envision, Brides today is curated with you in mind. We’re committed to bringing you an inclusive look at the world of weddings, striving to represent every type of partnership and celebration.</p><br /><br />
                <h1 className=" text-3xl font-serif font-meidum my-6">The Brides Team</h1>
                <p className=" text-lg font-serif font-normal">The Brides editorial team has experienced every aspect of the wedding first hand, from being shower planners and party goers to wedding attendees for family and friends. Some of us have even walked down the aisle ourselves, or are in the midst of planning! With the help of our longstanding relationships with industry experts like planners, photographers, fashion designers, and florists, we are committed to making your wedding planning journey a stress-free, memorable, and enjoyable experience..</p><br />
